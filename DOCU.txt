#####TEXTURES#####

- Textures are rendered in shader code 
- Textures can be held in a float var using texture2D() method 
- you can set a texture through iterating through the pixels in a vertice array (Vector3 vars are arrays). The for loop must first iterate through the y-axis then through the x-axis with a nested for loop. A texture could then be set over the entire mesh based on the vertice x and y count.

UVs are used to wrap a texture correctly. 
- How do you set the UV data based on the faces?

You set the UV coordinate data in the nested for loop
